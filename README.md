# Library Management System

This project is a library management system developed using SQL for the database and queries. It provides functionalities for managing books, authors, users, and loans.

## Database Structure

The system utilizes the following tables in the database:

- `users`: Stores information about users registered in the library.
- `books`: Contains details about the books available in the library.
- `authors`: Holds information about the authors of the books.
- `thematic`: Stores the literary themes of the books.
- `lends`: Records the loans of books to users.

## Available SQL Queries

The system provides the following SQL queries to perform various tasks:

**âœ…Â T**otal number of books in the database.

**âœ…Â T**otal number of users registered in the library.

**âœ…Â N**umber of books borrowed by a specific user.

**âœ…Â B**ooks borrowed by a particular user.

**âœ…Â H**ow many books have been returned and how many are still on loan?

**âœ…Â T**he most prolific author in the database.

**âœ…Â T**he oldest book in the database.

**âœ…Â T**otal number of loans made in the database.

**âœ…Â H**ow many books are currently on loan?

**âœ…Â H**ow many books a particular user has borrowed in a specific year?

**âœ…Â T**he most popular book in the database (the most borrowed).

**âœ…Â N**ext due date for a borrowed book.

**âœ…Â T**he user who has borrowed the most books overall.
