# Library Management System

This project is a library management system developed using SQL for the database and queries. It provides functionalities for managing books, authors, users, and loans.

## Database Structure

The system uses the following tables in the database:

- `users`: Stores information about users registered in the library.
- `books`: Contains details about the books available in the library.
- `authors`: Holds information about the authors of the books.
- `thematic`: Stores the literary themes of the books.
- `lends`: Records the loans of books to users.

## Available SQL Queries

The system provides the following SQL queries to perform various tasks:

✅ **Total number of books in the database.**

✅ **Total number of users registered in the library.**

✅ **Number of books borrowed by a specific user.**

✅ **Books borrowed by a particular user.**

✅ **How many books have been returned and how many are still on loan?**

✅ **The most prolific author in the database.**

✅ **The oldest book in the database.**

✅ **Total number of loans made in the database.**

✅ **How many books are currently on loan?**

✅ **How many books a particular user has borrowed in a specific year?**

✅ **The most popular book in the database (the most borrowed).**

✅ **Next due date for a borrowed book.**

✅ **The user who has borrowed the most books overall.**
